See the paper CryptDNN: A fast privacy-preserving machine learning architecture on deep neural network
This work combined BFV(FHE) + SSE(key exchange protocol) to achiveve privacy-preserving image classification on deep neural network
To run this work, you should install some packages as follows:
numpy
torch
torchvision
Crypto
Pyfhel=2.3.1
